## Overview

This sample code has the following features:

- By connecting ATOM Lite to the RCA connector (video input: NTSC) on a CRT or digital TV, ATOM Lite can display weather information. The video resolution is 480i.
- ATOM Lite connects to the Internet via a WiFi access point.
- ATOM Lite accesses Thing Speak's channels to get temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure information.
- ATOM Lite displays the weather forecast for the day based on information from the unofficial JMA(Japan Meteorological Agency) forecast API.
- ATOM Lite displays the time synchronized with an NTP server.

## Note

I found out that the [ESP_8_BIT_composite](https://github.com/Roger-random/ESP_8_BIT_composite) library consumes at least 120KByte of heap memory. If you want to know why, check out the `ESP_8_BIT_composite::frameBufferAlloc()` method of this library.
